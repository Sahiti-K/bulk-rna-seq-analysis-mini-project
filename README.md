# Bulk RNAâ€‘seq Expression Analysis Mini Project 
This repository presents a miniâ€‘project in bulk RNAâ€‘seq analysis, structured as a reproducible workflow. It illustrates the core steps of exploratory RNAâ€‘seq data analysis using a small demonstration dataset, while providing a framework that can be readily scaled to realâ€‘world datasets.

## What is Bulk RNAâ€‘seq? ðŸ§¬
Bulk RNA sequencing (bulk RNAâ€‘seq) is a highâ€‘throughput technique used to measure gene expression across an entire population of cells.
- RNA molecules are extracted from a sample (e.g., tissue, blood, or cultured cells), converted into cDNA, and sequenced.
- The resulting reads are aligned to a reference genome or transcriptome and counted per gene.
- Unlike singleâ€‘cell RNAâ€‘seq, which captures expression at the level of individual cells, bulk RNAâ€‘seq provides an average expression profile across all cells in the sample.
- It is widely used to identify differentially expressed genes, study biological pathways, and compare conditions (e.g., Healthy vs Disease).

*This project uses a toy dataset to illustrate the logic of bulk RNAâ€‘seq analysis in a simplified, reproducible way.*

## Overview
- Type: Bulk RNAâ€‘seq (synthetic dataset)
- Samples: 5 (3 Healthy, 2 TB)
- Genes: 6 synthetic gene IDs
- Goal: Showcase the essentials of bulk RNAâ€‘seq analysis in a modular, annotated, and reproducible format

## Workflow Steps
- Dataset creation â€“ build a mini dataset
- Inspection â€“ check dimensions, IDs, and metadata integrity
- Perâ€‘gene statistics â€“ compute mean, SD, variability
- Perâ€‘sample totals â€“ library size assessment
- Condition means â€“ Healthy vs TB averages
- Foldâ€‘change proxy â€“ TB/Healthy ratios with safe division
- Upregulated genes â€“ identify TBâ€‘responsive genes
- Filtering & pruning â€“ remove low/noisy genes
- Reordering & renaming â€“ tidy sample and gene IDs
- Visualization â€“ barplot of library sizes
- Unified summary table â€“ consolidate all metrics
- Export â€“ save results into results/

## Usage
- Run the analysis script in R:
source("script_and_report/Workflow_RScript.R")

## Outputs:
- Console summaries at each step
- Barplot of library sizes (saved in results/)
- Exported gene_summary.csv (in results/)
- Full report in script_and_report/

## Significance of the Analysis
This mini-project illustrates the core logic of bulk RNA-sequencing analysis in a modular and reproducible manner.
- Bridges raw data to insight: from raw counts to interpretable summaries
- Highlights QC principles: library size checks, filtering, pruning
- Conditionâ€‘specific insights: identify TBâ€‘responsive genes
- Reproducible structure: unified summary tables and exports
- Scalable logic: same workflow scales to real RNAâ€‘seq datasets
